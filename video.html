                        <p>
                            The object is an animation video that tells a
                            story of a character named “Dotte”.
                            The object narrates a journey of an introvert’s
                            mental state through Dotte’s talk show host
                            career and his ability of object morphing.
                            Visually, the object also shows an evolution of
                            User Interface Design through Dotte’s appearance
                            which is injected with a retrospective style,
                            which includes 8-bit, Skeuomorphism, Flat and 3D
                            style.
                            Aesthetically, the object creates a mix of
                            various design styles and intends to make
                            seamless transitions through each style.

                            the video consists of two parts: motion graphics
                            intro and animation narrative. It also questions
                            me the
                            original intention and consistency of the

                            of graphic design, and whether people that fail
                            to follow
                            such trend can recognise the connotation which
                            is supposed
